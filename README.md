# Azure Favicon Extension
With more than 200 unique services, any microsoft azure heavyweight have had their tabs look like this:

![Azure tabs before](https://github.com/dragonoverlord3000/Azure-favicon-CE/blob/master/images/before.png?raw=true)

Which can be confusing and annoying to navigate! But using the <i>Azure Favicon</i> extension, your whole microsoft azure experience is revolutionized! What was a confusing mess before turns into:

![Azure tabs after](https://github.com/dragonoverlord3000/Azure-favicon-CE/blob/master/images/after.png?raw=true)


## To Do
1. Fix cases where the bladeicon is an image - not an svg element:
![case1](https://github.com/dragonoverlord3000/Azure-favicon-CE/blob/master/images/case1.png?raw=true)

2. Add support for more, related sites e.g. DevOps

3. Add toggle button to popup for turning extension on/off at specific sites

4. Make firefox version (thanks 1superheld)
